            Interface Polymorphism
            As it relates to interfaces, polymorphism states that you can represent an instance of a class as an instance of any interface that the class implements.
            Interface polymorphism can help to increase the flexibility and modularity of your code. Suppose you have several classes that implement an IBeverage
            interface, such as Coffee, Tea, Juice and so on. You can write code that works with any of these classes as instances of IBeverage, without knowing any
            details of the implementing class.
