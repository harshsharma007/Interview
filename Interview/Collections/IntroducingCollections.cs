            Introducing Collections
            When you create multiple items of the same type, regardless of whether they are integers, strings or a custom type such as Coffee, you need a way of
            managing the items as a set. You need to be able to count the number of items in the set, add items to or remove items from the set, and iterate through
            the set one time at a time. To do this, you can use a collection.
            
            Collections are an essential tool for managing multiple items. They are also central to developing graphical applications. Controls such as drop-down list
            boxes and menus are typically data-bound to collections.
            
            Choosing Collections
            All collection classes share various common characteristics. To manage a collection of items, you must be able to:
            
            1. Add items to the collection
            2. Remove items from the collection
            3. Retrieve specific items from the collection
            4. Count the number of items in the collection
            5. Iterate through the items in the collection, one item at a time.
            
            Every collection class in Visual C# provides methods and properties that support these core operations. Beyond these operations, however, you will want
            to manage collections in different ways depending on the specific requirements of your application. Collection classes in Visual C# fall into the following
            broad categories:
            
            1. List classes store linear collections of items. You can think of a list class as a one-dimensional array that dynamically expands as you add items.
               For example, you might use a list class to maintain a list of available beverages at your coffee shop.
            
            2. Dictionary classes store a collection of key/value pairs.
