            Extending Structs
            In order to go beyond a simple struct, you can extend it by adding properties and indexers. This section discusses using properties and indexers in your
            struct. Again, if you find yourself going to this extent, evaluate your use of structs against class files.
            
            Creating Properties
            In Visual C#, a property is a programming construct that enables client code to get or set the value of private fields within a struct or a class. To
            consumers of your struct or class, the property behaves like a public field. Within your struct or class, the property is implemented by using accessors,
            which are a special type of method. A property can include one or both of the following:
            
            1. A get accessor to provide read access to a field.
            2. A set accessor to provide write access to a field.
            
            The following example shows how to implement a property in a struct:
        */
    }
}
